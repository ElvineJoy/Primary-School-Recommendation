# Primary School Recommendation Application.

# Expected web appearance

## All about PSRA.
The main objective of this application is to make it easy for a parent or parents who are looking for schools <br> 
for their child. There is an uprise of number of primary schools which may lead to confusion of where to begin.<br>
We have set out a search app that lists schools that meet the criteria of what they are seeking in terms of <br>
Primary education.

## Usefulness of the project.
Parents can search whatever number of options they would like to consider, at the comfort of their <br> 
homes, offices or even when having their me time. They will also get contact details to contact the administration <br>
and for more info, they can get website URLs.

## How to get started on the app.
Just visit our webpage on *to enter url*, select the criteria you want, get the schools and voila! You have a place to begin.
